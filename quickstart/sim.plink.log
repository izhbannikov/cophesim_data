100 markers to be included from [ sim.plink.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ sim.plink.fam ] 
10000 individuals read from [ sim.plink.fam ] 
10000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
5000 cases, 5000 controls and 0 missing
0 males, 10000 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ sim.plink.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 100 SNPs
10000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 100 SNPs
After filtering, 5000 cases, 5000 controls and 0 missing
