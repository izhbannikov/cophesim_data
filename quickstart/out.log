100 (of 100) markers to be included from [ testout_pheno_cont.txt.map ]
Warning, found 10000 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ out.nosex ]
10000 individuals read from [ testout_pheno_cont.txt.ped ] 
10000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a quantitative trait
Missing phenotype value is -9
0 males, 0 females, and 10000 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 100 SNPs
10000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 100 SNPs
After filtering, 10000 individuals with non-missing status
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 10000 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing linear model association results to [ out.assoc.linear ]
